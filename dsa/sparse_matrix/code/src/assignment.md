# Sparse Matrix Operations

## Overview
This project implements basic operations on sparse matrices using Python, such as:
- **Matrix Addition**
- **Matrix Subtraction**
- **Matrix Multiplication**

Sparse matrices are optimized to save memory by only storing non-zero elements. This project reads sparse matrices from text files, performs the operations, and writes the results to an output file.

## Directory Structure
The project is organized into the following directory structure:


## Features
- **Optimized Memory Usage**: Only non-zero elements of the matrix are stored.
- **Matrix Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of sparse matrices.
- **Input Validation**: Detects invalid file formats and throws appropriate exceptions.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your system.
- No external Python libraries are used, as per the assignmentâ€™s requirements.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sparse_matrix.git
   cd sparse_matrix/code/src
